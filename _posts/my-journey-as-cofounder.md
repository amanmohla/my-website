I started writing this post when we shipped the first version of [TableHero](http://tablehero.com/) back in 2016. A lot has changed since then. Now that we have wrapped up our journey, its time to finish and publish this post to mark the end of this story.

# 2016

We just shipped the first version of [TableHero](http://tablehero.com/) a few days back. Our first set of beta customers were mom and pop run restaurants in Portland, US. I was really excited to see the dream come true.

## Introducing TableHero

It was back in February 2014, when [Deap Ubhi](https://medium.com/u/8f3be6a393bf) connected with me about building a reservation and waitlist management terminal for US-based restaurants. The pitch was simple — develop an intuitive, smarter and affordable OpenTable competitor. Although, I had no clue about OpenTable, but I disposed of the idea because I could relate to the pain points identified by Deap.

-   \$1295 installation and training fee.
-   \$249/month subscription fee.
-   $1 per diner from OpenTable and $.25 per diner from your website.

$1600 only to take reservations from your website. And on top of that, you pay $1 for each diner who reserves through OpenTable. I would call that daylight robbery.

It was evident that this space had a lot of opportunities. So after spending just about a year at [Freecharge](https://www.freecharge.in/), I decided to quit my job and travel to the US to understand the reservation and waitlist management space.

Few months in the US and after talking to a dozen restaurants, it was clear that there was a dire need of a similar yet simpler system to manage reservations and waitlist. A system which could go head-on with OpenTable and challenge its dominance.

## Build-Measure-Learn

I spent about three months in the US. During this time, I worked closely with [Deap Ubhi](https://medium.com/u/8f3be6a393bf) and [Funsize](https://medium.com/u/3477c2033ff), prototyping a spec for our reservation management system. We wanted to build an iPad app for restaurants to manage reservations and waitlists. The app allowed restaurants to manage bookings added either manually or via the website widget. The app can smartly predict when the restaurant is reaching its capacity and automatically add reservations in a waitlist queue.
Restaurant owners/managers had to enter their hours of operation and table map. This data is then used by the app to dynamically calculate available time-slots for diners based on their party size. The restaurant had the flexibility to take reservations in 15 or 30-minute intervals.

In September 2014, we hired [Rounak Jain](https://medium.com/u/7b24869a21ac) to build the iOS app. Meanwhile, I returned to India and relocated back with my parents in Delhi, where I started working on the backend API’s for the app. I also started building a front-end widget which the restaurants could easily integrate with their website to allow online reservations.
I liked the idea of having a reservation widget. It allowed restaurants to take reservations from their website. Depending on a third-party website now felt like a thing of past. Website visitors can now be potential customers using the Tablehero reservation widget.

## Real artists ship

It took [Rounak Jain](https://medium.com/u/7b24869a21ac) and me about five months to build the first working prototype of the Tablehero app. The first version allowed restaurants to manage reservations and walk-ins. With everything in place, we decided to set up this app at [Avatars](http://www.enjoyavatars.com/) (Deap’s family restaurant).

Deploying the app at Avatars was an astounding experience. For on-boarding, we needed a lot of information — table map with their seating capacity, timesheets and reservation interval. Deap sketched the table layout and provided me with all the information on a piece of paper. To my surprise, the hand-drawn sketch was enough to on-board [Avatars](http://www.enjoyavatars.com/) on the Tablehero app. The next step was to set up the reservation widget on their website. The website was using Squarespace. I had to add two custom lines of Javascript code which would then load the reservation widget on the site. It took me more than 3 hours to figure out how to add custom JS code on a Squarespace website. This experience made me realise that adding a new restaurant is going to be a hard problem to solve.

## From vision to reality: The innovation process

While on-boarding Avatar’s we had an epiphany — what if we could build websites for restaurants integrated with all the tools they need. A turn-key solution to manage all their tech needs.
A week later, I showed Deap a prototype of a tool which could build restaurant websites automagically. Restaurants had to type their name and Tablehero will build a website with all their information — address, phone number, pictures, reviews, menu, reservation widget, anything and everything that a restaurant would want to have on their website.
When I showed the demo to investors, they were amazed by how quickly Tablehero could build a beautiful, fully functional, responsive website for a restaurant. We knew we were onto something BIG with this. We fixed bugs and polished the entire prototype for investors. After a few pitches and meetings, we finally managed to raise \$1 million for Tablehero lead by [GrowX Ventures](http://growxventures.com/).

With enough working capital in the bank, I decided to move back from Delhi to Bangalore. We began setting up an office and hiring people. During this time, [Chetan Vaity](https://medium.com/u/53bfad64868e) also joined us as another co-founder. Chetan and I had worked together at Freecharge. I loved his “**Lets ship it”** attitude. Having him on-board was the best thing that happened with Tablehero.

After Chetan, we were joined by [En Chiang Lee](https://twitter.com/merl3n) , [Smitha Adhyam](https://medium.com/u/d4e7c577e2e8) , [parul bhatti](https://medium.com/u/9fd9a87f4cef) , [Gaurav Baheti](https://medium.com/u/f8e5035f0b0f) , [Rakesh Gupta](https://twitter.com/gupta_rakesh) , [Sourav Ray](https://medium.com/u/7230593c5277) , [JohnBabu](https://twitter.com/johnbk) , [Avijit Kumar](https://medium.com/u/a30f95a46332) , [Urvashi Soni](https://twitter.com/misss_popcorn) . They are some of the best and the brightest engineering minds I had the honour to work with. Without a doubt, this was the most talented engineering team in India.

We soon built and shipped the first version of Tablehero for restaurant in Portland, US.

# 2017

By 2017, we had built a complete suite of tools. Tablehero could now automatically build restaurant websites. The websites were integrated with widgets to take reservations and online orders. We also had the Tablehero iPad app to manage reservations, waitlists and dining room. It was a complete suite of products which satisfied all tech needs of a restaurant. But we were still struggling with one thing — sales.
Our product met all expectations, but we were still not getting new customers as quickly as we had thought. With over 65,000 restaurants in the US, we were struggling to hit the 100 customer mark. Our revenue graph was a flat line.
In 2017, I had also relocated to Singapore due to personal reasons. The entire team was still in Bangalore working hard to build the best possible product experience for restaurants. With my relocation to Singapore, I was hoping to unlock opportunities in a new market. But that did not go well.

Meanwhile, we started pitching to investors. We wanted to raise another round, but with our flat revenue curve, the investors were not taking us seriously. We found ourselves in a limbo where we needed additional capital to invest in sales and marketing to generate more revenue. But without revenue, additional capital was hard to come by.
Months passed and we were burning through our initial funding quickly. Both capital and customers were becoming a scarce resource. We could sense our days of gloom coming close-by.
2017 was dreadfully slow and we were hoping for a miracle that never happened. By October, we ran out of money in our bank. We were not able to pay salaries. In October we broke the heartbreaking news to our team. Miraculously, around the same time, [OneFC](https://www.onefc.com/) reached out to us for an aqui-hire. They wanted to hire the entire team. After a few round of interviews in Bangalore, OneFC offered to hire the entire team. However, not everyone ended up joining them. I was glad that none of them had to stay without a job for long. I, on the other hand, decided to join [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) and relocate to Sydney, Australia.

# 2018

Tablehero was still live and serving customers. Meanwhile, [Deap Ubhi](https://medium.com/u/8f3be6a393bf) was trying if we could get acquired by another company. A few companies did show interest in our product but it never piqued to the level of acquisition.

## What I learned

Starting a company is a journey. There are ample opportunities to learn different things while building a company. Tablehero was no different. When I look back at it, there are many things I would have done differently.

### Define a concise problem statement and focus on solving that

While building a product its easy to get distracted and start prioritising different things. I believe we did the same mistake while building Tablehero. We iterated between building a reservation management app, a website builder and an online ordering system. In doing so, we could never solve the onboarding problem. Had we been laser-focused on just building websites or reservation management system, the fate might have been different. We might have been able to push the product to market quickly, fix bugs or deliver customer delight.

### Monitoring, reliability and automation

Every software product has bugs. What’s important is to be aware of them. Our backend services lacked monitoring and automated testing. Because of which while building new features, we ended up breaking existing functionality. And without any monitoring, we never knew that the customer experienced an issue until they would report it back to us. Working at Atlassian and building services at scale makes me now realise the importance of monitoring and testing.

### Sales vision

As a team of engineers, we were neck-deep in building the product. We never cared about testing the product-market fit and validating our idea with a minimum viable product. We were building features with an assumption that restaurant owners will quickly adopt a Saas product and start using it. But, when the sales numbers were below expectations we had no idea what’s going wrong.
After founding a company, I now have the itch to try it again. Being a founder is mentally taxing but, the high you get building something which people would pay to use, cannot be described in words. Given a chance, I would love to start another company and build something again. When will that happen I am not sure, but I sure do keep thinking about it all the time.
