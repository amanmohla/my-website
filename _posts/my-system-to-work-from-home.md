# My daily workflow

Recently, I have been struggling to find rhythm and focus in my work. I get distracted easily, spend hours checking slack, e-mail or some other time consuming rabbit hole. And by the end of the day, I am exhausted, yet I have achieved very little.
I started by looking at how other people are organising their life and adjusting to this new _Work from Home_ norm. After reading a few blogs and going through a dozen notion templates I realised that almost all of them were too complex for me.
After giving this some more thought I realised that instead of adapting myself to a system, maybe I should adapt the system to what I want. So I spent some time thinking about my constraints and the kind of system I would want to work in.
After a lot of consideration I have decided to try and start with a routine custom built for myself. Now this routine is not a rigid set of rules. It is just the starting point for me to experiment and see how I work with this routine and todo system.

## The system

The simplest way to describe my system would be - a todo list and a routine which makes time for everything I need to do in my todo list.
It’s easier to follow things if you have planned a routine and carved out time for everything defined in your todo list. Having a routine will allow me to set realistic expectations on what can and cannot be done. With everything in my todo list, I can easily remove the cognitive load from my brain and focus on what I should be working on and when I can work on something. These are the exact problems I am facing right now. When I have time I am clueless about what I should be doing and when I am busy my mind is wandering and thinking endless things.

## The TODO list

I plan to use [Todoist app](https://todoist.com/app/) to manage my todo list. Honestly any app would do, but because I have been using Todoist for a while, I have built my system around it.
My system is also heavily inspired by [Getting Things Done - David Allen’s GTD Methodology](http://www.davidco.com).
Here is how the list will work:

1. **Capture everything**: I always believed that I can remember all the things that I need to do and do them whenever I get time. But I was completely mistaken with that ideology. I am terrible at remembering things and so are most people. Capture everything entails that no task is small or big, important or unimportant. If it is something that needs to be done, it needs to be captured. Not capturing your tasks leads to the problem where you either don’t know what to do when you have time or you don’t have time to do things. Every task, every idea, everything goes to my TODO inbox.
2. **Clarify**: This can should be done while capturing the task or whenever you get time to revisit your TODO list. The idea is to capture as much information as possible about the task. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. The more information you capture about what, why and how. The easier it will be for you to pick the task and get it done.
3. **Organise**: This is an activity that needs to be done everyday. Organising a task means assigning priority (I use 3 priority levels, 1 - most urgent, 2 - good if you can get it done today, 3 - its okay if you can’t do this today), assigning the number of pomodoro intervals required to complete the task and schedule (if it should be done today, tomorrow, next week)
4. **Let’s do it**: Start doing the task scheduled to be done today.
5. **Review**: I will do this at the end of the day where my goal is to reach zero tasks in my inbox today. I won’t be able to finish all the tasks for the day, but its important that I review how I performed and what needs to be rescheduled at a later date. Clearing the inbox at the end of your workday allows to relax and switch off from all work related things.

## My routine

I tried to build this routine to keep a balanced time for everything I want to do during my day.
::0545:: Wake-up alarm. I have always been an early riser. Starting my day early allows me to make the most of my day.
::0600:: Out of bed and start getting ready for workout. Workout can be a run, HIIT, bike ride.
::0630:: Out of the door for workout. A 35-50Km bike ride generally takes around 2 hours. For bike ride I need to be out of the door by ::0545:: so that I am back on time. Run takes about an hour so it fits in perfectly. HIIT workouts are quicker and are done within 30-40 minutes. Leaves me with more time to relax and meditate.  
::0745:: I should be back home before this time. If I am home earlier, I can use the buffer time to stretch and cool down. Ideally I should be ready to hit the shower by this time.  
::0815:: Start making breakfast. It is important that I am in kitchen and ready to cook. This gives me enough time to cook and enjoy my breakfast in peace.

**Office Hours Begin**
::0845:: Start planning and organising your work day. Do not check your e-mail or slack. Take a look at your calendar and TODO list to plan and organise your day’s tasks. [[My daily workflow/How to plan my day in 15 minutes?]]
::0905:: Start first pomodoro interval timer. Use this interval to get your most high priority item done. It is also a good idea to block your calendar for some focus time in morning.  
::0935::Second pomodoro interval timer to continue with the high priority tasks.
::1005::Third pomodoro timer interval. Ideally by the end of this timer you should be able to finish at least one high priority task.
::1030:: Big break time. Time to make coffee and get a short walk in balcony. I bet you would be exhausted after focusing on the high priority task for this long.
::1045:: Time to check e-mail and slack. Should reply to emails and slack messages if it takes less than 2 minutes. I can use this time to catch-up on all chats. While going through my chats and mails, new TODO tasks might surface. Its okay to just add them in your today’s todo list.
::1100::Pick a non work/focus related task. Maybe a priority 3 or priority 2 task that needs to be done. [[My daily workflow/How to label or categorise tasks between deep work or ad-hoc?]]
::1130:: Standup meeting, slack messages or continue finishing your ad-hoc task.  
::1150:: I have already added a block in my calendar and labeled this time as my break. Close your laptop and forget about work. Cook lunch, go for a short walk, run an errand or chore. This is your time to rejuvenate from work.
::1330:: I will leave this block open in my calendar for meetings. Or I can continue monitoring slack and do ad-hoc tasks or priority 2, priority 3 tasks.
::1400:: If nothing is scheduled and I have time, I can pick up a big task and try and finish it up by ::1500::
::1500:: Another short break. Make coffee, short walk within the house
::1515::Fourth pomodoro interval for deep focus.
::1545::Fifth pomodoro interval for deep focus work.
::1615:: This is when I take a break from office work and start looking at my personal projects. I should be able to organise some personal project work in my TODO list.
::1645::Break time. Eat a snack. Make something quick for Nimira. Check slack and email and wrap up your work day by sending any messages or finishing any ad-hoc tasks.
::1700::Pomodoro interval to perform some deep work on my personal project.
::1730:: Review today and organise tomorrow
**Office hours end**

Once I wrap up my day, I can then focus on enjoying the remaining day. It will allow me to completely switch off from work and be more present at home.

## How to plan my day in 15 minutes

## How to label or categorise tasks between deep work or ad-hoc

## Meal planning

- [ ] when will I plan my weekly meals?
- [ ] Cooking for nimira? I need to find time to cook for nimira during the day. Snacks, juice etc
- [ ] I work best when I have my TODO’s defined for the day. The TODO’s need to be defined with exactly what needs to be done and it should always have definition of done.
        Equipped with this information it gets really easy for me to work on this task and estimate the effort involved in this task.
        The problem is I am not sure how to cultivate this TODO list.

**Capture everything** You think you will remember it. Maybe you will remember it but you won’t be able to schedule when to do it. Not capturing your tasks leads to the problem where you either don’t know what to do when you have time or you don’t have time to do things. Every task, every idea, everything goes to TODO inbox.
**Clarify**: fully articulated the outcome you want. The tasks should have all the context and information required to get the task done.
**Organise**: I have atleast 5 pomodoros for office work. This can go upto 7 if I have no meetings or interviews scheduled. Atleast 2 Pomodoro for non trivial office work.
Atleast 2 pomodoro for personal and hobby projects. I need to organise my tomorrow task list based on these pomodoros.
The task in task list should be clearly amd concisely define. I should also add priority to each task. Also define the time it would take.
::Your aim should be to get to zero tasks for today and have atleast tasks for tomorrow which utilise the required pomodoro::
**Review** Early morning review the task list and fill any gaps if required.
