# My personal website

This code powers my personal space on internet. It powers my website [amanmohla.com](https://amanmohla.com). I use [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) & [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to build and run my website. With NextJS, I am also using typescript and styled components. 

## How to use it?

### Running it locally

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```
